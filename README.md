a java application to log surf sessions with in built forecast fetching
Waguan
So for my CS IB program i decided to combine two things that i love computer science and surfing 
This program uses magicseaweed data to fetch surf forecast information from a break of your choosing using the ID of the page

for example:
https://magicseaweed.com/Southlands-Surf-Report/3930/
3930 would be the surf ID,  is the break ID for one of my very shitty home breaks 
Ive tested it across multiple other breaks and it tends to work best on the breaks that dont have live cameras not sure why but it just does couldnt 
be fuckin asked to fix it to be honest spent too much damn time on this shit lol. 

but anyway the account part in the beginning is just a requirement that the IB wants so just go along with it and make an account. There you can input your break ID unit preferences etc. 

the program also, in the home page, fetches a random surf image from all the images ever uploaded to MSW. 

sorry for the shit write-up, ive attached a more in depth explanation of the features under crit C development 
Also a little video demonstration
